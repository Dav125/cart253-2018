Exercise 7 - Project 3 Prototype
by David Fong

I have no big directions for this assignment yet but
i'll think something

Oh I have an idea! the game is about catching fruits
from the air to make a fruit smoothie

Basically, you don't want to have the fruits  drop to
the ground 3 times or else it is gmame

******************/

// setup()
//
// variables for the fruits
var apple;
var orange;
var kiwi;
var banana;
var strawberry;

// variables for the player's avatar which is it is
// a blender

var blender;

function setup() {
createCanvas(640,480);

// Setting-up new fruits drop down
// Apple


// Orange


// kiwi


// banana


// strawberry


// Setting up the player avatar blender 


}

function draw(){

// Code for the state of the game


}
