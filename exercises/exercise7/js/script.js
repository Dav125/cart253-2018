Exercise 7 - Project 3 Prototype
by David Fong

I have no big directions for this assignment yet but
i'll think something

Oh I have an idea! the game is about catching fruits
from the air to make a fruit smoothie

Basically, you don't want to have the fruits  drop to
the ground 3 times or else it is gmame

******************/

// setup()
//
// variables for the fruits
var apple
var orange
var kiwi
var banana
var strawberry

// You can add more balls by setting a other variable
function setup() {
createCanvas(640,480);


}

function draw(){


}
